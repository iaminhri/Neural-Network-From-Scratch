 A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that helps computers process data
 in a way such that it can learn and automatically generate inferences on unseen data.
 Neural networks inspired by observing the way the human brain works, except the
 human brain always works in forward direction, whereas neural networks works in
 forward and backward directions. Neural network uses interconnected nodes in a
 layered manner to adjust weights and predict outputs. This assignment is related to
 implementing a neural network from scratch to train a model on provided or combined
 datasets such that the network is able to perform binary classification. The dataset
 contains good or motors. The goal is to successfully classify good and bad motors given
 an unseen dataset to the model. In part(A), this segment discusses the architecture,
 values for alpha, transfer functions, and iterations used to build the neural network
 model. Following that, part(B) breaks the input dataset into 3 sets proportionately
 keeping good and bad motors, and merges first two sets for training dataset and keeps
 the third portion of the dataset for testing the model. This section also, creates a loss
 graph which depicts the error of the training set and test for each of the 3 combinations
 created. Furthermore, discusses the way generalization effects with varying number of
 nodes in the hidden layer. Part(C) is built on top of part(B) adding momentum to show
 if the model’s accuracy increases or not. A comparison is also shown between part(B)
 and part(C). Following that, in part(D) a report of varying dataset combination is
 shown arguing the best results for a dataset. In part(E), the initial neural network
 model is extended to 5 layer model to see neural network’s behavior. In the last
 part(F), Softmax function is implemented at the output layer and a comparison is
 shown between the part(E) and part(F). Finally, this report concludes with the learning
 of the experiments done and model’s accuracy and shortcomings.
