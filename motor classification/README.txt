Hello,

Please install the requirements file for installing numpy, matplotlib library and seaborn.

pip install -r requirements.txt

if you already have you don't have to install it. 

Run only main.py

config.conf contains the parameters.

the model only allows for 1 hidden layer or 3 hidden layer, in other other 3 layered NN or 5 layered NN.

run mergeBins.py to merge two or more files together. you just mention in the config file's data section  how many files you want to merge together.

Thank you for your time.
